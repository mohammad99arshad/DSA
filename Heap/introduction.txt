indentification: k element
                 smalllest or lowest or closest
                 largest or greatest or top 

what heap to use :
 k + smalllest --> maxheap
 k + largest --> minheap

Above thing does not always work if u r not getting what to use 
take an example for it.

complexity: nlog(k)

declaration:
for maxheap: priority_queue<int> maxheap;
for minheap : 
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>minheap;

when there are pair in questin then define at the top:
# define pair<int, pair<int, int>>ppi
priority_queue<ppi, vector<ppi>, greater<ppi>>minheap;
